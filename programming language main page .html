 A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.
 Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source
 code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages,
 which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.Programming languages and computer coding have made life simpler for us. Whether itâ€™s 
 automobiles, banks, home appliances, or hospitals, every aspect of our lives depends on codes. No wonder, coding is one of the core skills required by most
 well-paying jobs today. Coding skills are especially of value in the IT, data analytics, research, web designing, and engineering segments.
