Disadventages of machine languages:
All operation codes have to be remembered,All memory addresses have to be remembered,It is hard to amend or find errors in a program written in the machine 
language.
Disadventages of assembly languages:
Like machine language, it is also machine dependent/specific,Since it is machine dependent, the programmer also needs to understand the hardware.
Disadventages of high-level languages:
A high-level language has to be translated into the machine language by a translator, which takes up time,The object code generated by a translator might be 
inefficient compared to an equivalent assembly language program.
