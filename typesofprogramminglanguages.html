<h2>types of programming languages</h2>.

There are many types of coding languages. This is because the base language that computers speak—which is binary machine language, just ones and zeros—is far 
too difficult to use alone. We need some kind of in-between language that humans can use to give effective orders to computers in a reasonable amount of time. 
Because all coding languages are just in-betweens, there are many types of languages that provide different levels of functionality. The first factor to consider
 when organizing these languages is high-level or low-level.
 High-Level Programming Languages:
 High-level coding languages have a higher level of abstraction. This means they are closer to human language, and farther from machine code. High-level 
 languages are easier to learn and use, but they usually offer less functionality and direct control over the computer. High-level languages tend to be more 
 automated, where a single programming command actually does many pre-programmed things to make programming easier and more efficient. 
Low-Level Programming Languages:
Low-level coding languages have a lower level of abstraction, and as you might expect, are the opposite of high-level languages. They are closer to binary and 
farther from human language. Low-level languages are harder to learn and use, but offer more functionality and direct control over the computer.While it may 
take more time and lines of code to do the same thing as a high-level language, low-level languages are far less restrictive and allow programmers to create 
far more detailed and efficient programs. 
Programming Paradigm
Beyond high-level or low-level, there are different styles of programming, called paradigms. Different languages allow for different styles of programming.
