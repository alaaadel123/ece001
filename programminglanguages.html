Language has been our primary mean of communication and human interaction for thousands of years. For a community, the language contained the words that the
 people need to communicate, words themselves are abstract, but they indicate the meaning, they point to objects or actions, etc..
When you look at your computer, you’ll find it’s not so much different. There are many pieces of hardware and software that need to communicate with each other.
 Your application is reacting to the mouse and keyboard or even the mic, it can read files from your disk storage and so on. But at the end of the day, the
 machine understands nothing but bits, 1s, and 0s, the combination of which creates meaning.The very earliest computers were actually programmed by changing 
 ones and zeros manually, alternating the circuit and the wiring. Of course, it was not easy to create many programs as most were used for specific applications 
 only, and they were gigantic in size so they were quite limited. That’s why the creation of programming languages was a revolutionary step that took the field
 to another level. Unlike normal languages, keywords in programming languages are limited, and by combining these keywords, developers are able to create
 different types of programs. There are special pieces of software that turn the code you write into machine language that the machine understands. So what is 
 programming language? In short, a programming language is the set of instructions through which humans interact with computers.
